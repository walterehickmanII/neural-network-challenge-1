# Neural Network Loan Repayment Prediction

This project aims to predict loan repayment success using a neural network model. The process is divided into four parts: data preparation, model compilation and evaluation, prediction, and a discussion on creating a recommendation system for student loans.

## Part 1: Prepare the Data

In this part, we prepare the dataset for use in a neural network model. The steps include reading the data, creating feature and target datasets, splitting the data, and scaling the features.

### Steps:
1. **Read the Data**:
    - Load the dataset from [student-loans.csv](https://static.bc-edx.com/ai/ail-v-1-0/m18/lms/datasets/student-loans.csv) into a Pandas DataFrame.
    - Review the DataFrame to identify feature and target columns.

2. **Create Features and Target Datasets**:
    - Define the features dataset (X) using all columns except "credit_ranking".
    - Define the target dataset (y) using the "credit_ranking" column.

3. **Split the Data**:
    - Split the features and target datasets into training and testing sets using `train_test_split` from scikit-learn.

4. **Scale the Features**:
    - Use scikit-learn's `StandardScaler` to scale the features data for better model performance.

## Part 2: Compile and Evaluate the Model

In this part, we design, compile, and evaluate a neural network model using TensorFlow. The model will predict the credit quality of a student based on the dataset's features.

### Steps:
1. **Design the Model**:
    - Create a Sequential model using TensorFlow.
    - Add appropriate layers considering the number of input features and desired complexity.

2. **Compile the Model**:
    - Compile the model with an appropriate optimizer, loss function, and metrics.

3. **Fit the Model**:
    - Train the model using the training data.

4. **Evaluate the Model**:
    - Calculate the model's loss and accuracy using the testing data.

## Part 3: Predict Loan Repayment Success

Use the trained neural network model to predict loan repayment success for new data or the testing dataset. Evaluate the prediction accuracy and interpret the results.

## Part 4: Discuss Creating a Recommendation System

In this part, we discuss how to create a recommendation system for student loans based on the trained neural network model. Considerations include:
- Personalizing loan offers based on predicted credit quality.
- Suggesting loan repayment plans tailored to individual financial situations.
- Integrating additional data sources to improve recommendation accuracy.
